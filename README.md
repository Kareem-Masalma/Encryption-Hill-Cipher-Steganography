# LSB Hill Cipher
**Project Description:**
Encrypt a Plaintext using Hill Cipher and hides the generated Ciphertext using LSB in a PNG or BMB images.  
For Decryption: The ciphertext is taken from the PNG image and sent to be decrypted using Hill Cipher.  
The matrix key values are generated randomly using the current time as a seed to ensure that the key is not redundant.  
The Least Significant Bit hides the message using Zig Zag pattern to be more secure.
